# Basic Library

This file contain the seconde lab of java401d5 course.

and it contain:

1. **roll** a method that takes in a number of trails and return an array of the dice face each time.
   - **rollTest** a unit test method that make sure the roll method is working properly by checking if the length of the array is equal to the number of trails and every element of the array is between 1 and 6.
2. **containsDuplicates** a method that takes in an array of integers and return true if the array contains duplicates and false if it does not.
   - **containsDuplicatesTest** a unit test method that make sure the containsDuplicates method is working properly by checking if the method returns true when the array contains duplicates and false when it does not.
3. **calculatingAverages** a method that takes in am array of integers and returns the average of the array.
   - **calculatingAveragesTest** a unit test method that make sure the calculatingAverages method is working properly by checking if the method returns the average of the array.
4. **arraysOfArraysAverages** a method that takes in an array of arrays of integers and returns one array of the smallest average of each array.
   - **arraysOfArraysTest** a unit test method that make sure the arraysOfArraysAverages method is working properly by checking if the method returns an array of the smallest averages of each array.

## Usage

To test the program, run the following command:

```bash
./gradlew test
```

To run the main method inside the Library Class user intelij idea to run the program.
